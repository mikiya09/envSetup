# step 1:
# cd /opt

# step 2:
# sudo mkdir homebrew

# step 3: make us the owner of the directory so that we don't need permission
# sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/homebrew

# step 4:
# curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew

# step 5:
# echo "export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc

# step 6:(optional)
# add path environment manually, so that you keep all personal setting to one place
# export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
